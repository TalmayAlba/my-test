        "text": "I am a post-doctoral researcher at the Chair of Political Sociology and Social Policy at Humboldt University in Berlin.",
        "text1": "Most of my research is driven by my interest in understanding the determinants of universal basic income support. In fact, this was the central topic of my doctoral dissertation. I am also interested more broadly in the determinants of welfare state preferences; of which I have also ongoing research and I am teaching a course at Humboldt University that I designed.",
        "text2": "My research interests also include information/processing of elites and public opinion, perceptions and determinants on feminist and sexual violence, as well as the role of interest groups in the policy process. You can find more about these interests here.",
        "text3": "Before joining Humboldt, I completed my PhD at the University of Barcelona 2017 to 2021, with Cum Laude. I completed this doctoral dissertation with a FPI scholarship of the ministry of competitiveness in the framework of the project transparency /q/dem . During this time, I collaborated with the research group Qdem in several projects like the transparency project and interest groups.",
        "text4": "Before engaging in my doctoral thesis, I completed a Masters degree on Political Analysis and Institutional advising at the University of Barcelona, where I also worked as a research assistant for the Q-dem research group. Before this, I also completed a BSc in Politics and International Relations at the University of Bath, and worked for the Saudi Arabian embassy in Madrid."

        "text": "My PhD dissertation analyses the determinants of universal basic income support in comparative perspective. Given the challenges of uncovering what particular aspects of different cash transfers are preferred, I designed my own. Some of this work has been accepted for publication in the Journal of European Public Policy and the Journal of European Social Policy."

        "text": "Some of my previous work has examined the role of interest groups in the policy process. During my years as a research assistant for QDEM and doctoral student I collaborated in the development of the first database to contain all interest groups in Spain. Aside from this database, we also designed a survey directed at this interest group population to find out more about their resources, activities, performance, etc. Part of this research derived into a research paper that explains the interactions between interest groups and political parties, in which we show that XXXXXX",

        "title": "INFORMATION/PROCESSING",
        "text": "One of my ongoing research interests is to understand how individuals process information. I am interested both in looking at public opinion and political elites, and whether or not they process this information differently, and if so why. In particular, I am interested at looking at the impact of scientific evidence in the attention given to information and whether this affects preferences or support towards different policies. I have already published a paper on this topic, and have other work in progress which you can find here."

        "text": "While formal gender equality is increasing, persistent inequalities remain between men and women. Some forms of inequality are not only remaining but are even exacerbating, one of such forms is sexual violence. In this sense, I am interested in studying public opinion perceptions on this matter, what and whether they identify as sexual violence. Crucially, my research focuses in exploring the drivers of such violence and effective policy interventions aimed at curbing this phenomenon. In previous research initiatives, I worked with a team of five women to explore the different forms of sexual violence, of which you can read more about here. I am currently working on a survey that will be conducted in all Catalan universities and will explore the perceptions of sexual violence and which are the most effective interventions to halt this phenomenon. This research is funded by the Josep Irla Foundation."
